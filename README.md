# Face-Detector
This project is done in python and comprises of several components which include:

- Haar Cascade Frontal face classifiers. These are algorithms which detect what is a face in a given image. They are based on the Haar Wavelet technique to analyze pixels in the image into squares by function.
-  createData.py for training the data
-  detectFace.py for detecting faces from the trained data.
- Numpy
