# Face-Detector
This project is done in python and comprises of components. Among them are the Haar Cascade Frontal face classifiers. These are algorithms which detect what is a face in a given image. They are based on the Haar Wavelet technique to analyze pixels in the image into squares by function. The project has two source files. One for training the data, and the other for detecting faces, from the trained data.
# Libraries used include Numpy and OpenCv
